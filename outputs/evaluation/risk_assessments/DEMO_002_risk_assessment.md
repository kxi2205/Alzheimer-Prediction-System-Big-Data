## Risk Level Interpretation

### 🟡 MODERATE RISK (4-6 points)

**Clinical Significance:**
- Elevated risk profile requires enhanced monitoring and intervention
- Patient has identifiable risk factors that may be modifiable
- Early intervention may significantly impact disease trajectory

**Monitoring Recommendations:**
- Increase cognitive screening frequency to every 6 months
- Consider neuropsychological testing within 12 months
- Implement targeted risk reduction strategies
